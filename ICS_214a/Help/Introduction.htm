<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
An ICS-214 is an Activity Log.  It's original intention was to record the activity of a 
single event.  Furthermore, the individual activities were only noted at the beginning of
the activity, that is, the start time was recorded by the end time was not.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, during this pandemic we are constrained to stay within safe boundaries.  This 
prevents most of us going to some activity with numbers of people in attendance.  So our
activities become little things over the course of weeks or months.  The purpose of this
application is to allow capturing the time spent on each of these little activities over the course
of a long period (e.g. a month).  The application captures the start time, end time and a comment
on the activity.  During the display of the log, the total time is computed and displayed.
</p>
<p>
The operation is fairly straight forward:
<ul>
<li>When the application starts it requests that a file be loaded</li>
<li>When an activity is to start, the 2nd toolbar icon (<img src="Images/Activity.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Activity Icon"> 
activity or motion symbol) is 
selected to enter the date, time and acitivity description</li>
<li>When an activity is to be completed, the 3rd toolbar icon 
(<img src="Images/StopActivity.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Stop Activity Icon"> 
stop activity icon) is selected to add an end 
time to one of the unfinished activities (if there are more than one)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  The first toolbar icon (<img src="Images/Header.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Header Icon"> 
  page with header) allows one to edit the header and footer information. 
  The fourth toolbar icon 
  (<img src="Images/EditActivity.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Edit Activity Icon"> 
  activity with astick or star) allows any log entry to be edited. 
  The fifth toolbar (<img src="Images/NewLog.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="New Log Icon"> 
  fresh document) icon allows one 
  to create a new Activity Log File and supply the header and footer information.  
  The sixth toolbar icon (<img src="Images/OpenLog.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Open Log Icon"> 
  opening folder) allows another log file to be opened.  The seventh toolbar icon 
  (<img src="Images/SaveLog.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Save Log Icon"> floppy disk)
  will allow one to store the current log somewhere else.  The eight toolbar icon 
  (<img src="Images/PrintLog.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Printer Icon"> printer) allows
  one to print the current log data.
</p>
<p>
Between invocations of the application the last activity log will be presented to the user to
load when starting the application.  Times and dates will be supplied in the dialog boxes
when they are started.  The dates and times are editable.  The dates and times are monitored 
to ensure that they are legal dates and times.  Furthermore they are normalized so no matter how
they are input they will always have the same form (i.e. 01/02/20 for dates, 01:02 for times).
Commas and quotes are handled correctly within strings.  End dates most often are on the same day
as the start time but provisions are made so that they may be on later times.  Long descriptions 
are wrapped nicely most of the time when printed.
